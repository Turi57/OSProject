# Tacos Shop Operating System

This application is for a Taco Shop (Tacos Franc). 
The project is going to have three main parts:

* Scheduling algorithms to manage orders:
```
  Tacos, Tostadas, Tortas, Quesadillas, Mulitas --> "Ordenes": Asada, Adobada, Suadero, Lengua, Cabeza.
  "Ingredientes": Cebolla, Cilantro, Salsa, Frijoles y Guacamole.
  "Threads": Taqueros, Tortillera, Meseros.
```
* Meta information about waiting times, resources status, maintenance, available waiters, available tables, standing eating spaces.
* Realtime visualizations about metadata.

### Prerequisites

You need to install a library in python to see the graphs of the project.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Installing

In the terminal of linux you can write the next example:

```
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
```
And that's it, now you can see how the real time graphs of the project interact.
